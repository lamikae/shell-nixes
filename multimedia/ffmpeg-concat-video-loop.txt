# Create video loop out of short video fragments using ffmpeg

Make a text file. Contents of an example text file to repeat 4 times.

	$ cat list.txt
	file 'input.mp4'
	file 'input.mp4'
	file 'input.mp4'
	file 'input.mp4'

Then run ffmpeg:

	ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy output.mp4

This example is the same as above but you don't have to manually make list.txt:

	for i in {1..4}; do printf "file '%s'\n" input.mp4 >> list.txt; done
	ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy output.mp4

With most commonly-used modern shells, you can even avoid the creation of the list.txt file entirely. For example, with bash:

	ffmpeg -f concat -i <(for i in {1..4}; do printf "file '%s'\n" input.mp4; done) -c copy output.mp4
